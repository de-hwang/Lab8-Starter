Graceful degradation is a design approach where an application is built to provide basic functionality even if certain components of the application fail or are not supported. Service workers act as a network proxy that allows the application to get offline features. Thus, service workers can be used in the event of a network failure/limited network, consequently achieving graceful degradation.
